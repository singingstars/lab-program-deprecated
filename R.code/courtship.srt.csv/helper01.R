# The summarySE function is also defined on this page. If you only are working with between-subjects variables, that is the only function you will need in your code. If you have within-subjects variables and want to adjust the error bars so that inter-subject variability is removed as in Loftus and Masson (1994), then the other two functions, normDataWithin and summarySEwithin must also be added to your code; summarySEwithin will then be the function that you call.

## Summarizes data.
## Gives count, mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and confidence interval (default 95%).
##   data: a data frame.
##   measurevar: the name of a column that contains the variable to be summariezed
##   groupvars: a vector containing names of columns that contain grouping variables
##   na.rm: a boolean that indicates whether to ignore NA's
##   conf.interval: the percent range of the confidence interval (default is 95%)
